# Handheld video game system

#### Things required :
* 1 TI MSP-EXP432P401R Microcontroller
* 1 Educational BoosterPack MKII
* 1 USB 2.0 A to Micro B Cable
* Code Composer Studio running on either Windows or Mac
---
#### Motivation :
In order to understand how Embedded systems work, this project was taken up.
Furthermore learning video game development by writing replicas of old legacy games help us understand how a computer generates graphics and processes information even with constrained resources.

---

#### Future Work
* Implement multithreading using RTOS
* Improve AI logic and make the game faster
